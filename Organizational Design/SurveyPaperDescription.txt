Contemporary research identifies four primary frameworks for understanding **organization design**: **configuration**, **control**, **channelization**, and **coordination**. The **configuration** approach emphasizes achieving a **fit** between internal structures and the external environment to optimize performance, often addressing the challenges of **reorganization** and **misfit**. Through a **control** lens, design is viewed as a tool to align individual actions with collective goals using **incentives** and the strategic allocation of **authority**. The **channelization** perspective focuses on how structure directs **managerial attention** and shapes the psychological environment in which decisions are made. Finally, **coordination** studies explore how **knowledge flows** and **centralization** help integrate specialized units within complex systems. Together, these sources argue that while the field is historically fragmented, it is evolving toward a more cohesive **scientific theory** capable of guiding practical management decisions.
