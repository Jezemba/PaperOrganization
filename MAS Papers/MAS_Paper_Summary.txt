These sources describe the emergence of **autonomous multi-agent AI systems** designed to revolutionize complex engineering and scientific research. By coordinating specialized **Large Language Model (LLM)** agents, these frameworks automate entire workflows, including **problem formulation, high-fidelity simulation, and technical manuscript writing**. Specific implementations like **turbulence.ai** and **DesAgent** demonstrate how these systems integrate external tools, such as **finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics**, to achieve expert-level results. Beyond traditional engineering, these agents are being applied to **materials discovery, power system analysis, and satellite mission design** to enhance human decision-making. Research indicates that **multi-agent architectures** consistently outperform single-agent models by effectively resolving conflicts and maintaining logical coherence across multi-step tasks. Ultimately, these advancements aim to **accelerate innovation** while reducing the manual workload traditionally required for sophisticated technical design.
