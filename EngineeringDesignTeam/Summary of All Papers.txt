These sources examine the intricate relationship between **organizational structures**, **team dynamics**, and the development of **complex engineering systems**. Research highlights how **artificial intelligence** acts as both a transformative tool for design and a new category of autonomous agents requiring specialized **governance and interdisciplinary roles**. Studies into **team size** and **concurrent design facilities** reveal that while larger groups do not necessarily produce more requirements, a mismatch between a project's technical architecture and the team’s organizational "fit" can hinder performance. Furthermore, the texts analyze **rational decision-making** under uncertainty, suggesting that **Bayesian optimization** can serve as a benchmark for human designers. Collectively, the literature underscores that managing modern engineering complexity requires balancing **divisionalization and hierarchy** to accommodate emerging AI technologies and evolving collaborative environments.
